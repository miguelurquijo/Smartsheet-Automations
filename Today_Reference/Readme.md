<p>Smartshett function '=Today()' returns the current date, the issue with htis function is that required the user to enter the sheet in order to recalculate the value of the date. If you have a solution in Smartsheet were multiple sheets required the current date, this function is not very efective since you will need to make sure to open each sheet every day.</p>

<p>I create this script to update a cell with the current date each day and then I create cross-sheet refernces to point this cell wherever I need to, this way all my sheet will get the updated current date without the need to opening any sheet.</p>
